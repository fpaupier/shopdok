#  Shop Dock üêô

A boilerplate project for python flask + react dockerized.

- A backend project `product` handles the product catalog (a python flask app).
- A frontend project `freshstore` serves a react app to browse the sample product catalog.

Both services have a `Dockerfile` and a `docker-compose.yaml` is available in the project root to build it up.

## Getting started

Run `docker-compose up --build`
